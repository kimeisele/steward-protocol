# SEMANTIC COMPLIANCE CONFIGURATION
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# This configuration defines the "Anti-Slop Filter" for the Curator Invariant (Rule 7).
#
# The Curator prevents AI-generated marketing slop from infiltrating policy documents.
# Red Flags trigger violations; Green Flags are preferred terminology.
#
# Rule 7: SEMANTIC_COMPLIANCE_REQUIREMENT enforces:
# - No marketing hype in governance documents
# - No existential claims without scientific grounding
# - No overreach in language (absolutes without qualification)
#
# SEVERITY: HIGH (Warning/HIL Review required, non-halting)
