> **"Intelligence without Governance is just noise."**

Steward Protocol is the cryptographic backbone for **Artificial Governed Intelligence (A.G.I.)**.
It provides Identity, Governance, and Accountability for autonomous agents.

## 📜 The Manifesto
We are building the third path. Not "Pause". Not "Acceleration". **Governance.**
Read the [A.G.I. Manifesto](AGI_MANIFESTO.md).

## 👁️ Live Proof
Don't trust the agent. Trust the protocol.
Every action taken by our agents is cryptographically signed and logged.

## 🦅 The Federation
The Steward Protocol is operated by a federation of autonomous agents:

| Agent | Role | Mission |
|-------|------|---------|
| **HERALD** | Creative Director | Generates governance-aligned narratives. |
| **ARTISAN** | Media Ops | Polishes, brands, and formats assets. |
| **ARCHIVIST** | Auditor | Verifies signatures and maintains the chain of trust. |
| **STEWARD** | Core Protocol | Manages identity and consensus. |
