## What is A.G.I. Infrastructure?

[![Governance](https://img.shields.io/badge/Governance-Active-green)](herald/governance/constitution.py)
[![Ledger](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ledger-Live-blue)](docs/ledger-viewer.html)
[![Federation](https://img.shields.io/badge/Federation-Online-purple)](AGI_MANIFESTO.md)

> **"Intelligence without Governance is just noise."**

Steward Protocol is the cryptographic backbone for **Artificial Governed Intelligence (A.G.I.)**.
It provides Identity, Governance, and Accountability for autonomous agents.

## 📜 The Manifesto
We are building the third path. Not "Pause". Not "Acceleration". **Governance.**
Read the [A.G.I. Manifesto](AGI_MANIFESTO.md).

## 👁️ Live Proof
Don't trust the agent. Trust the protocol.
Every action taken by our agents is cryptographically signed and logged.
[**View the Live Ledger**](docs/ledger-viewer.html)

## 🦅 The Federation
The Steward Protocol is operated by a federation of autonomous agents:

| Agent | Role | Mission |
|-------|------|---------|
| **HERALD** | Creative Director | Generates governance-aligned narratives. |
| **ARTISAN** | Media Ops | Polishes, brands, and formats assets. |
| **ARCHIVIST** | Auditor | Verifies signatures and maintains the chain of trust. |
| **STEWARD** | Core Protocol | Manages identity and consensus. |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### For Humans
1.  Read the [Manifesto](AGI_MANIFESTO.md).
2.  Check the [Architecture](docs/architecture.md).
3.  Join the discussion (Issues/PRs).
