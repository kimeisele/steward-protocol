agi_definition:
  acronym: "Artificial Governed Intelligence"
  core_principle: "Intelligence without Governance is just noise."
  technical_definition: "Capability + Cryptographic Identity + Accountability"
  core_belief: "Trust is scarce. Governance is essential. Cryptographic proof is proof."
  distinction_from_agi_myth: |
    The old AGI definition (Human-Level General Intelligence) is a distraction.
    The new AGI definition is: Artificial systems with built-in governance, cryptographic identity, and cryptographic accountability.
    This is what matters. Not superintelligence myths. Real responsibility.
