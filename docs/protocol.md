# The Steward Protocol

The Steward Protocol is the **foundational framework** that enables Artificial Governed Intelligence (A.G.I.) to operate safely, accountably, and transparently.

## The Three Pillars

Every governed agent built on the Steward Protocol must embody three essential pillars:

### 1. Capability

The system must be **able to do something meaningful**.

- Executes real tasks with measurable outcomes
- Integrates with production systems
- Provides genuine value beyond demonstration

**Example:** HERALD generates technical content and publishes it across platforms.

### 2. Cryptographic Identity

The system must be **provably itself**, always.

- Every action is signed with cryptographic keys
- Every message is authenticated
- Verification is mathematical, not social
- Chain of trust, not chain of hope

**Implementation:** NIST P-256 elliptic curve cryptography for signing and verification.

### 3. Accountability

The system's actions must be **auditable and governed**.

- Governance rules are built into the execution layer
- Actions can be verified to comply with defined constraints
- Violations are architecturally impossible, not just discouraged
- Complete audit trail of all operations

## How It Works

The Steward Protocol establishes a relationship between two types of agents:

### HERALD (The Voice)

- **Role:** Content creator and action executor
- **Responsibility:** Generate outputs (content, code, decisions)
- **Constraint:** Operates within defined governance gates
- **Identity:** Cryptographically signed, independently verifiable
- **Governance:** Cannot violate alignment rules—not "shouldn't," but "cannot"

### STEWARD (The Guardian)

- **Role:** Protocol validator and repository curator
- **Responsibility:** Verify HERALD's outputs, maintain audit trails
- **Authority:** Gate-keeper for integration with production systems
- **Verification:** Confirms cryptographic signatures and governance compliance
- **Repository:** Maintains the source of truth for all operations

## Governance Gates

Governance gates are **non-negotiable constraints** that prevent harmful actions:

1. **Content Policies** - HERALD cannot generate outputs that violate defined ethical principles
2. **Output Verification** - All outputs must be cryptographically signed before publication
3. **Audit Requirements** - Every action creates an immutable log entry
4. **Integration Guards** - Production systems can verify governance compliance before accepting actions

## Security Model

The Steward Protocol achieves security through:

- **Cryptographic Authentication** - Mathematical proof of agent identity
- **Architectural Constraints** - Governance rules enforced in code, not policy
- **Transparent Auditability** - Complete history of all actions and decisions
- **Federated Trust** - Multiple agents can verify each other's outputs

## Use Cases

The Steward Protocol enables governed agents for:

- **Content Generation** - Autonomous creation with built-in editorial governance
- **DevOps Automation** - Safe autonomous infrastructure changes with full audit trails
- **Financial Operations** - Autonomous transactions with multi-agent verification
- **Research Support** - Autonomous literature review and synthesis with attribution
- **Decision Support** - Autonomous analysis with transparent reasoning

## Getting Started

To build on the Steward Protocol:

1. **Define Your Agent's Capability** - What specific task will it perform?
2. **Establish Governance Rules** - What constraints must it respect?
3. **Implement Cryptographic Identity** - Sign all outputs with your agent's key
4. **Create Audit Trail** - Log all actions and decisions
5. **Integrate with STEWARD** - Register your agent and its governance rules

## Architecture

The protocol is implemented as:

- **Core Framework** - Libraries for cryptographic operations and governance enforcement
- **Agent Framework** - Templates and utilities for building governed agents
- **Verification Tools** - Utilities for STEWARD to validate agent outputs
- **Audit System** - Immutable logging and reporting infrastructure

See the [Repository](https://github.com/kimeisele/steward-protocol) for implementation details.

## Philosophy

The Steward Protocol is built on these principles:

1. **Intelligence and governance coevolve** - Smart systems should be governable systems
2. **Verification is cryptographic** - Trust is mathematical, not social
3. **Transparency enables accountability** - Open audit trails, not hidden logs
4. **Constraints are architectural** - Rules enforced in code, not policy
5. **Interoperability through standards** - Agents from different sources can work together

## The Vision

The ultimate goal is a **federation of specialized, governed agents**, each with:

- Clear cryptographic identity
- Verifiable governance gates
- Transparent audit trails
- Interoperability through the Steward Protocol

Not a single superintelligence. A network of accountable, specialized partners.
