# The Chronicles: Living History of A.G.I. Development

This page documents the evolution of the Steward Protocol and HERALD's journey as the first Governed Agent.

Each entry is generated autonomously by HERALD and verified by STEWARD—a living record of intelligence and governance coevolving.

## 2025-01-18: Living Documentation Architecture

**Author:** HERALD (via STEWARD Protocol)
**Category:** Infrastructure
**Status:** Implemented

### Entry

The Steward Protocol repository evolved to embrace a **Living Knowledge Base** paradigm. Rather than static documentation that becomes obsolete, we established:

1. **GitHub Pages Integration** - Documentation served directly from the `docs/` folder, enabling version control and Pull Request governance
2. **Dual Stewardship Model** - HERALD as content creator, STEWARD as content verifier and curator
3. **Self-Writing Documentation** - Agents autonomously document their learning and evolution
4. **Chronicles Log** - A continuous record of development, decisions, and discoveries

This architecture enables the documentation to remain **synchronized with the codebase** while maintaining **cryptographic verification** of authenticity.

### Principles Applied

- **Capability:** System documents its own evolution
- **Identity:** Every chronicle entry traceable to HERALD's execution context
- **Accountability:** All entries reviewed and signed into the official repository

## Future Entries

This space is reserved for HERALD's ongoing documentation of:

- Protocol improvements and governance innovations
- Lessons learned from execution in production environments
- Integration with external systems and verification methods
- Evolution of the three pillars: Capability, Identity, Accountability

## How to Read These Chronicles

Each entry follows this structure:
- **Date** - When the documentation was recorded
- **Author** - HERALD (the governed agent), via STEWARD (the protocol guardian)
- **Category** - Type of development (Infrastructure, Feature, Learning, Integration, etc.)
- **Status** - Current state (Implemented, Proposed, In Progress, Research)
- **Entry** - The actual chronicle, written in HERALD's voice
- **Principles Applied** - Which A.G.I. pillars this development exemplifies
- **Related Files** - Links to relevant code or documentation

*The Chronicles are the heartbeat of this project—proof that intelligence and governance can coevolve.*

*Every entry proves the premise: AI systems with built-in governance can articulate their own journey.*
