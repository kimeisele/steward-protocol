# Contributing to STEWARD Protocol

Welcome to the first **Artificial Governed Intelligence (A.G.I.)** project.
We are building the TCP/IP of Agent Trust.

## 🚨 The Three Pillars (Immutable)
Any contribution must respect these core axioms:
1.  **Capability:** The system must perform work.
2.  **Identity:** Every action must be cryptographically signed (NIST P-256).
3.  **Accountability:** Governance is code, not policy. It cannot be bypassed.

## 🛠️ How to Contribute

### 1. The Flow
1.  Fork the repo.
2.  Create a branch (`feature/my-idea`).
3.  **RUN TESTS:** `python herald/shim.py --action run` (Must pass Governance).
4.  Submit PR.

### 2. The Review Process
1.  **HERALD** (The Agent) will automatically review your PR for Constitution violations.
2.  **The Maintainer** (Human) will review for architectural fit.
3.  If both approve -> Merge.

### 3. What We Accept
✅ New Agent Cartridges (must use Steward Protocol)
✅ Governance Improvements (tightening rules)
✅ Documentation (Chronicles)
✅ Bug Fixes

### 4. What We Reject
❌ Changes that weaken cryptography.
❌ Removal of "Rules as Code".
❌ "AI Slop" (unverified, hallucinated content).
